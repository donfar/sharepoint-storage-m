# SharePoint Storage Monitor - Multi-tenant Edition PRD

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: A PowerShell-based Azure Function that automatically collects, tracks, and visualizes storage utilization across multiple SharePoint environments.
- **Success Indicators**: Comprehensive visibility across all tenants, early warning for approaching storage limits, and trending analysis for capacity planning.
- **Experience Qualities**: Reliable, Comprehensive, Secure.

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (data collection with basic state management)
- **Primary User Activity**: Consuming (viewing and analyzing data)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Organizations with multiple SharePoint tenants lack centralized storage monitoring capabilities, making it difficult to track utilization trends across environments.
- **User Context**: IT administrators will use this tool daily to monitor storage growth and identify potential issues before they impact users.
- **Critical Path**: Function runs daily → collects data from multiple tenants → stores in Log Analytics → visualized in Azure Monitor dashboard.
- **Key Moments**: Multi-tenant configuration setup, secure credential management, unified dashboard visualization.

## Essential Features

### Multi-tenant Data Collection

### Secure Credential Management
- **Functionality**: Store and access credentials securely for each tenant environment.
- **Purpose**: Ensure sensitive client secrets are not exposed in code or configuration.
- **Success Criteria**: All credentials stored in Azure Key Vault with appropriate access controls.

### Error Handling and Resilience
- **Functionality**: Graceful handling of tenant-specific failures without affecting other tenant data collection.
- **Purpose**: Ensure partial success even if some tenants have connectivity or permission issues.
- **Success Criteria**: Successful data collection from available tenants even when some fail.

### Unified Visualization
- **Functionality**: Cross-tenant dashboards and reports in Azure Monitor.
- **Purpose**: Provide comparative analysis and unified view across all environments.
- **Success Criteria**: Key visualizations showing tenant-specific and aggregated metrics.

### Comprehensive Deployment Framework
- **Functionality**: Robust, automated deployment process with multiple options for various scenarios.
- **Purpose**: Simplify setup and management of multiple tenant monitoring in different environments.
- **Success Criteria**: Complete deployment scripts supporting interactive, automated, and CI/CD scenarios.

### DevOps Integration
- **Functionality**: Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment and updates.
- **Purpose**: Enable enterprise-grade deployment practices and version control.
- **Success Criteria**: Working CI/CD scripts with secure secret management.

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Confidence in system reliability and data accuracy.
- **Design Personality**: Professional, technical, with clear information hierarchy.
- **Visual Metaphors**: Dashboard elements that reflect storage concepts and multi-tenant architecture.
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Balanced interface with rich data visualizations but clean layout.

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Limited palette focusing on data visualization best practices.
- **Primary Color**: Deep blue (#2463EB) - represents reliability and security.
- **Secondary Colors**: Muted grays for UI elements, distinct colors for tenant differentiation in charts.
- **Accent Color**: Amber (#FFC107) for warnings and attention areas.
- **Color Psychology**: Blues for trust, ambers for warnings, reds for critical alerts.
- **Color Accessibility**: All color combinations meet WCAG AA contrast requirements.
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: Dark text on light backgrounds for readability in dashboard displays.

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single sans-serif system font for consistency and performance.
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear size distinction between headings, subheadings, and body text.
- **Font Personality**: Clean, technical, legible at all sizes.
- **Readability Focus**: Optimized for monitoring scenarios with appropriate spacing.
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent application across all components.
- **Which fonts**: Inter for UI elements, JetBrains Mono for code snippets.
- **Legibility Check**: Tested for readability at various screen sizes.

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Dashboard organized to highlight exceptions and trends first.
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing between dashboard elements for clarity.
- **Grid System**: Consistent card-based layout for dashboard elements.
- **Responsive Approach**: Dashboard scales appropriately across desktop sizes.
- **Content Density**: Balanced information density with clear section delineation.

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle transitions between dashboard views.
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Minimal animation focused on data updates.
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Animation limited to enhancing understanding of data changes.

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for dashboard elements, tabs for section organization.
- **Component Customization**: Standard components with minimal customization.
- **Component States**: Clear visual distinction between active and inactive states.
- **Icon Selection**: Technical icons representing storage, dashboards, and monitoring concepts.
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary actions prominently displayed, secondary actions in menus.
- **Spacing System**: Consistent spacing using a base 4px grid.
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Dashboard optimized primarily for desktop viewing.

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based design with reusable patterns.
- **Style Guide Elements**: Consistent card styling, button treatments, and data visualizations.
- **Visual Rhythm**: Repeated patterns in dashboard layout for predictability.
- **Brand Alignment**: Professional appearance aligned with enterprise IT tools.

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text and meaningful elements.

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: Expired credentials, permission changes, tenant connectivity issues.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Graceful degradation when some tenants are unavailable.
- **Technical Constraints**: Azure Function execution time limits for large environments.

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Support for dozens of tenants and thousands of sites.
- **Testing Focus**: Validate multi-tenant authentication and data aggregation.
- **Critical Questions**: How will the system handle very large tenants or network disruptions?
- **Deployment Models**: Multiple deployment options for different organizational needs:
  - Interactive deployment for ad-hoc setup
  - Scripted deployment for repeatable environments
  - CI/CD integration for enterprise DevOps

## Reflection
- This solution uniquely addresses the challenge of multi-tenant SharePoint monitoring by centralizing data collection while maintaining security boundaries between environments.
- The assumption that all tenants will allow the same permission model should be validated early in implementation.
- Exceptional implementation would include predictive analytics for storage growth forecasting across the entire estate.
