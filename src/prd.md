# SharePoint Storage Monitor - Planning Guide

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: Create a PowerShell application that runs as an Azure Function to track and visualize SharePoint storage utilization over time.
- **Success Indicators**: Consistent data collection, accurate visualization in Azure Monitor/Log Analytics, and proper error handling.
- **Experience Qualities**: Reliable, Informative, Automated.

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- **Primary User Activity**: Consuming (viewing visualized data)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Organizations need to monitor SharePoint storage usage over time to manage capacity planning and understand growth patterns.
- **User Context**: IT administrators will rely on this tool to track storage trends without manual intervention.
- **Critical Path**: Function execution → SharePoint data collection → Data storage → Visualization in Azure Monitor
- **Key Moments**: 
  1. Automated data collection with secure authentication
  2. Successful error handling and logging
  3. Data visualization and trend analysis

## Essential Features
1. **PowerShell Script for SharePoint Data Collection**
   - What: PowerShell script that authenticates to SharePoint and retrieves storage metrics
   - Why: Provides the raw data needed for analysis
   - Success: Consistently retrieves accurate storage utilization data

2. **Azure Function Integration**
   - What: Configuration to run the PowerShell script as a daily Azure Function
   - Why: Enables automated, scheduled execution without manual intervention
   - Success: Reliable daily execution with appropriate timeouts and retry logic

3. **Secure Credential Management**
   - What: Integration with Azure Key Vault or managed identities
   - Why: Ensures sensitive credentials aren't hardcoded in scripts
   - Success: No exposed credentials in code or logs

4. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - What: Comprehensive error handling with appropriate logging
   - Why: Ensures reliability and troubleshooting capabilities
   - Success: Clear error messages and recovery mechanisms

5. **Module Management**
   - What: Logic to check for and install required PowerShell modules
   - Why: Ensures the function has all dependencies without redundant installations
   - Success: Script runs without module-related failures

6. **Azure Monitor/Log Analytics Integration**
   - What: Code to format and send data to Azure Monitor
   - Why: Enables visualization and trend analysis
   - Success: Data appears correctly in dashboards/charts

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Solution should handle multiple SharePoint sites or large tenants
- **Testing Focus**: Authentication flow, error scenarios, data consistency
- **Critical Questions**: 
  - What specific SharePoint metrics are most important to track?
  - What is the ideal frequency for data collection?
  - Are there any API rate limits to consider?

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: SharePoint API throttling, credential expiration, network issues
- **Edge Case Handling**: Implement retry logic, timeout handling, and graceful degradation
- **Technical Constraints**: Azure Function execution time limits, PowerShell module compatibility

## Reflection
- This approach is uniquely suited as it leverages Azure's native capabilities (Functions, Key Vault, Monitor) for a complete monitoring solution.
- The automation eliminates the need for manual data collection while providing valuable insights through visualizations.
- To make this solution exceptional, we should focus on comprehensive error handling and clear documentation.
